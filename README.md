The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc.

| Container  | Containers are used to manage collections of objects of a certain kind. There are several different types of containers like deque, list, vector, map etc.         |
| Algorithms | Algorithms act on containers. They provide the means by which you will perform initialization, sorting, searching, and transforming of the contents of containers. |
| Iterators  | Iterators are used to step through the elements of collections of objects. These collections may be containers or subsets of containers.                           |



####  Containers 
To store objects and data. There are in total seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.

###### Sequence Containers:
Implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.
- vector
- list
- deque
- arrays
- forward_list*( Introduced in C++11)*

###### Container Adaptors:
provide a different interface for sequential containers.
- queue
- priority_queue
- stack

###### Associative Containers : 
Implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
- set
- multiset
- map
- multimap

#### Algorithm
- Sorting
- Searching
- Important STL Algorithms

###### Unordered Associative Containers : 
Implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched
- unordered_set *(introduced in c++11)*
- unordered_multiset *(Introduced in C++11)*
- unordered_map *(Introduced in C++11)*
- unordered_multimap *(Introduced in C++11)*

- Searching
